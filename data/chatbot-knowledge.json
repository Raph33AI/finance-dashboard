  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the best time to invest in an IPO?",
      "answer": "Most experts suggest waiting 3-6 months after IPO for several reasons:\n\n1. **Lockup Expiration** (typically 180 days): Insiders can sell, often causing price drops\n2. **Price Stabilization**: Initial hype fades, price finds fair value\n3. **More Data**: 1-2 quarterly earnings reports provide better insight\n4. **Lower Volatility**: Post-lockup period usually less volatile\n\n**Exception:** If you have high conviction based on fundamentals and the IPO prices reasonably (not at high end of range), buying on day 1 can work for long-term holds.\n\n**Best Practice:** Research thoroughly, don't chase hype, use limit orders (IPOs can spike/crash), only invest what you can afford to lose."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I evaluate if a stock is overvalued or undervalued?",
      "answer": "Use multiple methods for comprehensive valuation:\n\n**1. Relative Valuation (Comparables)**\n• P/E ratio vs industry average (lower = potentially undervalued)\n• PEG ratio < 1 (undervalued), > 2 (overvalued)\n• Price-to-Book < 1 (undervalued for asset-heavy businesses)\n• EV/EBITDA vs peers\n\n**2. Absolute Valuation**\n• DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis - complex but most accurate\n• Compare current price to DCF-derived intrinsic value\n\n**3. Growth Considerations**\n• High P/E can be justified if growth is high (check PEG)\n• Compare revenue/earnings growth to valuation multiples\n\n**4. Qualitative Factors**\n• Competitive advantages (moat)\n• Management quality and capital allocation\n• Industry trends and tailwinds\n• Regulatory environment\n\n**Red Flags:**\n• P/E >30 with slowing growth\n• Declining margins despite revenue growth\n• High debt + low cash flow\n• Negative FCF for mature companies\n\n**Remember:** Price ≠ Value. A $500 stock can be cheap, a $10 stock can be expensive."

      "question": "What's the difference between market cap and enterprise value?",
      "answer": "**Market Cap = Share Price × Shares Outstanding**\n• Represents equity value only\n• What you'd pay to buy all shares\n• Ignores debt and cash\n\n**Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Cap + Debt - Cash**\n• Represents total company value (equity + debt)\n• What you'd pay to acquire the entire business\n• More accurate for comparing companies\n\n**Why EV Matters:**\n\n1. **Debt Consideration:** Company A and B both have $10B market cap, but A has $5B debt and B has $0 debt. B is cheaper (lower EV).\n\n2. **Cash Consideration:** Company C has $10B market cap and $3B cash. True EV is only $7B (you get $3B cash with purchase).\n\n3. **Better for Comparisons:** EV/EBITDA is better than P/E for comparing companies with different capital structures.\n\n**When to Use:**\n• **Market Cap:** Simple comparisons, size classification, index weighting\n• **Enterprise Value:** M&A analysis, valuation across industries, comparing companies with different leverage"

    {
      "question": "Should I invest in dividend stocks or growth stocks?",
      "answer": "Depends on your **goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation:**\n\n**DIVIDEND STOCKS**\n\n**Pros:**\n• Regular income stream (3-6% yields typical)\n• Lower volatility (defensive)\n• Tax-advantaged (qualified dividends taxed at 0-20%)\n• Compounding through DRIP (dividend reinvestment)\n• Better in bear markets/recessions\n\n**Cons:**\n• Lower growth potential\n• Can underperform in bull markets\n• Dividend cuts during crises\n• Less tax-efficient in taxable accounts\n\n**Best For:** Retirees, income-focused investors, conservative portfolios, high tax brackets (vs bonds)\n\n**Examples:** JNJ, KO, PG, VZ, T\n\n---\n\n**GROWTH STOCKS**\n\n**Pros:**\n• Higher potential returns (20%+ annually possible)\n• Benefit from compounding (no dividend tax drag)\n• Ride long-term secular trends (tech, innovation)\n• Tax-efficient (control when to realize gains)\n\n**Cons:**\n• Higher volatility (50% drawdowns possible)\n• No income stream\n• More risk of permanent loss\n• Harder to value (future growth uncertain)\n\n**Best For:** Young investors (long time horizon), growth-focused portfolios, high risk tolerance\n\n**Examples:** NVDA, TSLA, AMZN, META, GOOGL\n\n---\n\n**BALANCED APPROACH (Recommended for Most):**\n• **Under 40:** 80% growth, 20% dividend\n• **40-55:** 60% growth, 40% dividend\n• **55-65:** 40% growth, 60% dividend\n• **Retired:** 20% growth, 80% dividend/bonds\n\n**Or:** Use index funds (VOO, VTI) that include both (~1.5% yield + 7% growth = 8.5% total return historically)"

      "question": "How much of my portfolio should be in IPOs?",
      "answer": "**Conservative Recommendation: 5-10% maximum**\n\nHere's why:\n\n**HIGH RISK FACTORS:**\n1. **Volatility:** 50-80% swings in first year common\n2. **Limited Data:** No long-term track record\n3. **Lockup Expirations:** Insider selling at 180 days causes drops\n4. **Hype Premium:** Often overpriced at IPO (investors overpay)\n5. **Failure Rate:** ~60% of IPOs trade below offer price after 3 years\n\n**ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK:**\n\n**Conservative Investor (Low Risk Tolerance):**\n• **0-3% in IPOs**\n• Focus: Profitable companies, proven business models\n• Examples: Established tech (when they IPO), consumer brands\n\n**Moderate Investor (Medium Risk Tolerance):**\n• **5-8% in IPOs**\n• Mix: Some growth stories, some profitable IPOs\n• Diversify across 3-5 IPOs (don't concentrate)\n\n**Aggressive Investor (High Risk Tolerance, Young):**\n• **10-15% in IPOs**\n• Focus: High-growth potential, disruptive companies\n• Accept higher volatility for potential outsized returns\n\n**BEST PRACTICES:**\n1. **Never chase day-1 hype** - wait for lockup, earnings data\n2. **Diversify across sectors** - don't put all in one industry\n3. **Only invest what you can afford to lose** - IPOs can go to zero\n4. **Research deeply** - read S-1 filing, understand business model\n5. **Have an exit plan** - know when to cut losses or take profits\n\n**Historical Context:**\n• Best-performing IPOs (GOOGL, AMZN, NFLX) = life-changing returns\n• Worst-performing (WeWork, Theranos) = total losses\n• **Average:** Slightly underperforms market in first 3 years\n\n**Conclusion:** IPOs should be a **small, speculative portion** of a diversified portfolio, not the core."

      "question": "What's a good Sharpe Ratio?",
      "answer": "**Sharpe Ratio** measures risk-adjusted returns: (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation\n\n**Interpretation:**\n• **< 0:** Losing money (worse than risk-free rate)\n• **0-1:** Subpar (not enough return for the risk taken)\n• **1-2:** Good (acceptable risk-adjusted returns)\n• **2-3:** Very Good (strong risk-adjusted performance)\n• **> 3:** Excellent (exceptional risk-adjusted returns, rare)\n\n**Context:**\n• S&P 500 long-term: ~0.4-0.5 (decent)\n• Top hedge funds: 1.0-1.5\n• Warren Buffett (lifetime): ~0.8\n• High-frequency trading firms: 2.0+\n\n**Limitations:**\n• Assumes normal distribution (fails for fat-tail events)\n• Penalizes upside volatility same as downside\n• Historical metric (past ≠ future)\n\n**Better Alternative for Investors: Sortino Ratio** (only penalizes downside volatility)"
