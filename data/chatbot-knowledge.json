    {
      "question": "What is the best time to invest in an IPO?",
      "answer": "There's no universally 'best' time. Many experts suggest waiting 3-6 months after IPO for price stabilization and more financial data. The lockup period expiration (typically 180 days) often creates volatility. Research the company thoroughly and invest based on fundamentals, not hype."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I evaluate if a stock is overvalued or undervalued?",
      "answer": "Compare multiple metrics: P/E ratio vs industry average, PEG ratio (P/E divided by growth rate), Price-to-Book ratio, and DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis. Also consider qualitative factors like competitive advantages, management quality, and industry trends."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between market cap and enterprise value?",
      "answer": "Market Cap = Share Price × Shares Outstanding. Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt - Cash. EV gives a more complete picture of company value as it accounts for debt and cash, making it better for comparing companies with different capital structures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I invest in dividend stocks or growth stocks?",
      "answer": "It depends on your goals. Dividend stocks provide regular income and lower volatility, suitable for income-focused or conservative investors. Growth stocks offer higher potential returns but more volatility, better for long-term capital appreciation. A balanced portfolio often includes both."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much of my portfolio should be in IPOs?",
      "answer": "IPOs are higher risk. Most financial advisors recommend limiting IPO exposure to 5-10% of your portfolio. Prioritize established companies and diversification. Only invest in IPOs you've thoroughly researched and understand."
